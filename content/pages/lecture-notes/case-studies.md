HBS Case: 9–396–311, BAE Automated Systems (A): Denver International Airport Baggage-Handling System describes the events surrounding the construction of the BAE baggage-handling system at the Denver International Airport. It looks specifically at project management, including decisions regarding budget, scheduling, and the overall management structure. Also examines the airport's attempt to work with a great number of outside contractors, including BAE, and coordinate them into a productive whole, while under considerable political pressures. Approaches the project from the point of view of BAE's management, which struggles to fulfill its contract, work well with project management and other contractors, and deal with supply, scheduling, and engineering difficulties. Setting: Denver, CO; Construction industry; Engineering; 365 employees; 1989–1994.

Alternatively, we will discuss a "live" case based on BP's emerging wind energy portfolio in North America.
